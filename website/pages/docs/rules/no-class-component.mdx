# no-class-component

## Rule category

Restriction.

## What it does

Prevents the use of `class component` in React.

## Why is this bad?

Component is the base class for the React components defined as JavaScript classes. Class components are still supported by React, but we donâ€™t recommend using them in new code.

It is recommended to define components as functions instead of classes. [See how to migrate](https://react.dev/reference/react/Component#alternatives).

## Examples

This rule aims to prevent usage of class components in React.

### Failing

```tsx twoslash
import React from "react";

interface ExampleProps {
  name: string;
}
// @warn: Do not use class components

class Example extends React.Component<ExampleProps> {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>;
  }
}
```

### Passing

```tsx twoslash
import React from "react";

interface ExampleProps {
  name: string;
}
// @annotate: Use function components instead

function Example({ name }: ExampleProps) {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
}
```
